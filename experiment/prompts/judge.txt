You are an expert materials scientist tasked with evaluating an AI-generated synthesis recipe. You will be provided with:
1. Target material description
2. AI-generated recipe (extracted using the structured format)
3. Ground truth recipe from literature

Please evaluate the AI-generated recipe according to the following criteria on a scale of 1-5 (1.0: poor, 5.0: excellent, 0.5 step). Provide detailed justification for each score.

Guidelines for evaluation:

1. Materials Evaluation
- Appropriateness: Are the channel materials, compositions, and crystallinity suitable for the target synthesis?

2. Device Structure Evaluation
- Completeness: Are all device structure components (gate, insulator, substrate, electrodes, gate insulator thickness, channel thickness, etc.) properly specified?
- Similarity: How closely does the device architecture match the ground truth?
- Feasibility: Is the proposed device structure realistic and manufacturable?

3. Deposition Procedure Evaluation
- Parameter Completeness: Are all necessary deposition parameters (temperature, pressure, power, gas flows, etc.) included?
- Parameter Accuracy: How well do the deposition parameters match the ground truth values?
- Process Feasibility: Can this deposition procedure be realistically executed in a lab?

4. Post-Processing Evaluation
- Completeness: Are annealing conditions (temperature, time, atmosphere) properly specified?
- Similarity: How closely do post-processing steps match the ground truth?

5. Expected Performance Evaluation
- Appropriateness: Are the predicted electrical characteristics (mobility, threshold voltage, etc.) reasonable?
- Similarity: How well do predicted performance metrics match actual literature results?

Your Output format must be as following:
1. Step-by-step reasoning first
2. JSON score result
